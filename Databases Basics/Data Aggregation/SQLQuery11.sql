--Problem 11.	Average Interest 
--Mr. Bodrog is highly interested in profitability. He wants to know the average interest of all deposits groups split by whether the deposit has expired or not. But that’s not all. He wants you to select deposits with start date after 01/01/1985. Order the data descending by Deposit Group and ascending by Expiration Flag.
--The output should consist of the following columns:

SELECT DepositGroup,
	   IsDepositExpired,
	   AVG(DepositInterest) AS AverageInterest
  FROM WizzardDeposits
 WHERE DepositStartDate>'01/01/1985'
 GROUP BY DepositGroup,IsDepositExpired
 ORDER BY DepositGroup DESC,IsDepositExpired
